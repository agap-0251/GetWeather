# GetWeather-...
This is responsive Weather app.
I just used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. No Frameworks, No Libraries.This is to test my skills in handling 
API responses and modifing the DOM with plain Javascript.
Ofcourse, you can use React or Jquery to make to easily , you have to know what you can do without the 
help of libraries and frameworks.

I have to used WeatherAPI to access the weather details in various places.You can just go create an account
and you will get free access for few weeks and you have to pay if you still want to use the API
[Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
Here are few images of how the websites looks like.

The background images changes based on the conditions of weather (rainy, cloudy, snow, clear sky, day and night )which will look good.
You just have to use your own API key in JS file instead of mine.I only get it free for few weeks , so do you if you don't pay.
I will also include Forecasting the weather option and other cools options in the future.

You are welcome to suggest or share your views about the project.
